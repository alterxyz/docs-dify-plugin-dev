Developing Dify plugins requires the following preparations. This document is the first step to start [Plugin Development](/plugin_dev_en/0111-getting-started-dify-plugin.en).

*   Dify plugin scaffolding tool
*   Python environment, version â‰¥ 3.12

> The Dify plugin development scaffolding tool is also known as `dify-plugin-daemon` and can be considered the **Plugin Development SDK**.

### **1. Install the Dify Plugin Development Scaffolding Tool**

Visit the [Dify Plugin CLI](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon/releases) project address, download and install the tool for the latest version number and corresponding operating system.

This article uses **macOS with an M-series chip** as an example. After downloading the `dify-plugin-darwin-arm64` file, grant it execution permissions.

```bash
chmod +x dify-plugin-darwin-arm64
```

Run the following command to check if the installation was successful.

```bash
./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 version
```

> If you encounter an "Apple cannot check it for malicious software" error, go to **"System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Security"** and click the "Open Anyway" button.

If the terminal returns version information similar to `v0.0.1-beta.15` after running the command, the installation was successful.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:**
>
> If you want to use the `dify` command globally in your system to run the scaffolding tool, it is recommended to rename the binary file to `dify` and copy it to the `/usr/local/bin` system path.
>
> After configuration, entering the `dify version` command in the terminal will output the version information.
