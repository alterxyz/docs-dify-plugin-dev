When submitting a plugin listing application to the Dify Marketplace, you need to publicly state how you handle user data. Below are guidelines for filling out plugin-related privacy questions and user data handling. If you haven't developed a plugin yet, you can refer to the [Plugin Development Getting Started Guide](/plugin_dev_en/0211-getting-started-dify-tool.en).

The content of the plugin privacy policy declaration revolves around the following question:

**Does your plugin collect and use user personal data?** If yes, please organize and list the specific types.

> Personal data refers to any information that can identify a specific individual, including information that can be used alone or in combination with other information to identify, contact, or locate an individual.

#### **1. List the Types of Data Collected**

**Type 1: Directly Identifying Information**

*   Name (full name, first name, last name)
*   Email address
*   Phone number
*   Home address
*   Identification number (ID card, passport, driver's license, etc.)

**Type 2: Indirectly Identifying Information**

*   Device identifiers (IMEI, MAC address, device ID)
*   IP address
*   Location information (GPS coordinates, city, region)
*   Online identifiers (cookies, advertising IDs)
*   Username
*   Avatar/Profile picture
*   Biometric data (fingerprints, facial recognition)
*   Browsing history
*   Purchase history
*   Health data
*   Financial information

**Type 3: Combined Information Used to Identify Individuals**

*   Age
*   Gender
*   Occupation
*   Interests/Hobbies

Even if your plugin itself does not collect personal information, please confirm whether third-party services used by the plugin involve data collection or processing. As a developer, you need to disclose all data collection activities, including data processing by third-party services. Be sure to read the privacy policies of third-party services and declare all data collection involved in the plugin upon submission.

For example, if the plugin you are developing involves the Slack service, please reference [Slack's Privacy Policy](https://slack.com/trust/privacy/privacy-policy) in your plugin's privacy policy declaration file and state the data collection situation.

#### 2. Fill in the Latest Version of the Plugin Privacy Policy

The **Plugin Privacy Policy** must include:

*   Types of data collected
*   Purpose of data use
*   Whether data is shared with third parties (if yes, list the names of the third-party services and links to their privacy policies)
*   If you are unfamiliar with writing privacy policies, you can refer to the privacy policies within plugins officially maintained by Dify.

#### **3. Introduce the Privacy Policy Declaration in the Plugin Manifest File**

For detailed instructions on filling in the fields, please refer to [Define Plugin Information via Manifest File](/plugin_dev_en/0411-plugin-info-by-manifest.en).
