Hello! We're thrilled that you're interested in building Dify plugins. This developer documentation center is your core resource hub, designed to help you learn, create, debug, publish, and manage Dify plugins.

**What is a Dify Plugin?**

You can think of Dify plugins as modular components that grant AI applications **enhanced perception and execution capabilities**. They make it possible to integrate external services, custom functionalities, and specialized tools into AI applications built on Dify in a simple "plug-and-play" manner. Through plugins, your AI application can better "see," "hear," "speak," "draw," "calculate," "reason," connect to external APIs, and even perform real-world actions.

As a **plugin developer**, you can build exclusive functional extensions for your own Dify applications, or contribute your innovations to the entire Dify ecosystem for more users to benefit from.

**In this developer documentation, you will find:**
