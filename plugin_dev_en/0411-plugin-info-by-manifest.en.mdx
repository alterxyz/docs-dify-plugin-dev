description: Author: Yeuoly，Allen This document details the Manifest file in Dify plugins, a YAML file defining the basic information of a plugin. It includes a complete code example and detailed structure explanation, covering configuration aspects like plugin version, type, author, name, resource usage, permission requests, feature definitions, and runtime.
---

Manifest is a YAML-compliant file that defines the most basic information about a **plugin**, including but not limited to the plugin name, author, included tools, models, and other information. For the overall architecture of the plugin, please refer to [Basic Concepts of Plugin Development](/plugin_dev_en/0111-getting-started-dify-plugin.en) and the [Developer Cheat Sheet](/plugin_dev_en/0131-cheatsheet.en).

If this file's format is incorrect, both the plugin parsing and packaging processes will fail.

### Code Example

Below is a simple example of a Manifest file. The meaning and function of each data element will be explained below.

For reference to other plugin codes, please check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-sdks/tree/main/python/examples).

```yaml
version: 0.0.1
type: "plugin"
author: "Yeuoly"

      llm: true
    endpoint:
      enabled: true
    app:
      enabled: true

```

### Structure

*   `version`(version, required): Plugin version
*   `type`(type, required): Plugin type, currently only supports `plugin`, will support `bundle` in the future
*   `author`(string, required): Author, defined as organization name in Marketplace
*   `label`(label, required): Multi-language names
*   `created_at`(RFC3339, required): Creation time, must not be later than current time for Marketplace
*   `icon`(asset, required): Icon path
*   `resource` (object): Required resources
    *   `memory` (int64): Maximum memory usage, mainly related to AWS Lambda resource requests on SaaS, in bytes
    *   `permission`(object): Permission requests
        *   `tool`(object): Permission for reverse tool calls
            *   `enabled` (bool)
        *   `model`(object): Permission for reverse model calls
            *   `enabled`(bool)
            *   `llm`(bool)
            *   `text_embedding`(bool)
            *   `rerank`(bool)
            *   `tts`(bool)
            *   `speech2text`(bool)
            *   `moderation`(bool)
        *   `node`(object): Permission for reverse node calls
            *   `enabled`(bool)
        *   `endpoint`(object): Permission to register `endpoint`
            *   `enabled`(bool)
        *   `app`(object): Permission for reverse `app` calls
            *   `enabled`(bool)
        *   `storage`(object): Permission for persistent storage
            *   `enabled`(bool)
            *   `size`(int64): Maximum allowed persistent memory size in bytes
*   `plugins`(object, required): List of `yaml` files defining specific plugin capabilities, absolute paths within the plugin package. For example, if extending models, a file like `openai.yaml` needs to be defined, and its path filled here. The file at this path must exist, otherwise packaging will fail.
    *   Format
        *   `tools`(list\[string]): Extended [tool](/plugin_dev_en/0222-tool-plugin.en) providers
        *   `models`(list\[string]): Extended [model](/plugin_dev_en/0131-model-plugin-introduction.en) providers
        *   `endpoints`(list\[string]): Extended [Endpoints](/plugin_dev_en/0432-endpoint.en) providers
        *   `agent_strategies` (list\[string]): Extended [Agent strategy](/plugin_dev_en/9433-agent-strategy-plugin.en) providers
    *   Limitations
        *   Cannot extend both tools and models simultaneously
        *   Must have at least one extension
        *   Cannot extend both models and Endpoints simultaneously
        *   Currently supports only one provider per extension type
*   `meta`(object)
    *   `version`(version, required): `manifest` format version, initial version `0.0.1`
    *   `arch`(list\[string], required): Supported architectures, currently only `amd64` `arm64`
    *   `runner`(object, required): Runtime configuration
        *   `language`(string): Currently only supports python
        *   `version`(string): Language version, currently only supports `3.12`
        *   `entrypoint`(string): Program entry point, should be `main` for Python
*   `privacy` (string, optional): An optional field specifying the relative path or URL to the plugin’s privacy policy file, such as `"./privacy.md"` or `"https://your-web/privacy"`. If you plan to publish the plugin to the Dify Marketplace, **this field is required** to provide a clear statement on user data usage and privacy. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [Plugin Privacy Policy Guidelines](/plugin_dev_en/0312-privacy-protection-guidelines.en).
