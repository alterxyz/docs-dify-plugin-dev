title: Dify Plugin Development: Hello World Guide
summary: This document provides a detailed tutorial on developing Dify plugins from scratch, using a Telegraph publishing plugin as an example. It covers environment setup, project initialization, virtual environment configuration, plugin core logic development, local debugging, plugin metadata refinement, and packaging for release.
---

Welcome to the Dify plugin development getting started guide! This tutorial assumes you have basic programming knowledge and experience with the Dify platform. After completing this tutorial, you'll understand the fundamental process of creating simple Dify plugins, transitioning from a Dify user to a plugin contributor.

We'll demonstrate how to develop a simple Telegraph publishing plugin step by step. This tutorial primarily uses command-line operations with VSCode as the code editor example. **It's recommended to read through once to understand the overall process before following the steps.**

> **Note for LLMs:** This document's structure and content are also designed to guide LLMs in understanding the plugin development process, assisting with code generation, explanation, or debugging tasks.

Before starting, you can refer to our [**Developer Cheatsheet**](/plugin_dev_en/0131-cheatsheet.en) for common commands and information, or consult the complete developer documentation when encountering more complex issues.

## 1. Preparing the Development Environment

Before developing a Dify plugin, ensure you have the following tools in your environment:

- **Dify Plugin Development Scaffold (CLI):** This is the core tool for developing, debugging, and packaging plugins, also known as `dify-plugin-daemon` or "Plugin Development SDK".
- **Python Environment:** Requires Python 3.12 or higher.

### 1.1 Installing Dify Plugin Development Scaffold (CLI)

> For a more detailed guide on preparing the development environment, please refer to [Initialize Development Tools](/plugin_dev_en/0221-initialize-development-tools.en).

1. **Download:** Visit the [Dify Plugin CLI Releases](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-plugin-daemon/releases) page. Download the latest binary file corresponding to your operating system (Windows, macOS Intel/ARM, Linux).
2. **Set Execute Permission (macOS / Linux):**

        - **Following steps use macOS (Apple Silicon / M series chips) as an example**, assuming the downloaded file is named `dify-plugin-darwin-arm64`. In the terminal, navigate to the file directory and execute the following command to grant execute permission:

                ```bash
                chmod +x dify-plugin-darwin-arm64
                ```

        - For Linux users, download the corresponding Linux version file and execute a similar command like `chmod +x <downloaded_filename>`.
        - For Windows users, the downloaded `.exe` file can usually be run directly.

3. **Verify Installation:**

        - In the terminal, execute the following command to check if the tool runs correctly (replace `./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64` with your actual file name or path):

                ```bash
                ./dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 version
                ```

        - If the terminal successfully outputs version information (e.g., `v0.0.1-beta.15`), the installation is successful.

> **Tips:**
>
> - **macOS Security Alert:** If you see "Apple cannot verify" or "Cannot open" when first running on macOS, go to "System Settings" → "Privacy & Security" → "Security" section, find the related prompt and click "Open Anyway" or "Allow".
> - **Simplify Command:** You can rename the downloaded binary to a shorter name (e.g., `dpd` or `dify-plugin`) for easier use. Example: `mv dify-plugin-darwin-arm64 dpd`, then you can use `./dpd version`.
> - **Global Installation (Optional):** If you want to run the command from any path in the system (e.g., typing `dpd` instead of `./dpd`), you can move the renamed file to a directory included in the system's `PATH` environment variable, such as `/usr/local/bin` (macOS/Linux) or add it to Windows' environment variables.
>     - Example (macOS/Linux): `sudo mv dpd /usr/local/bin/`
>     - After configuration, typing `dpd version` directly in the terminal should successfully output the version number.

**For convenience, this document will use `./dpd` as the example command for the Dify plugin development scaffold. Please replace it with your corresponding command based on your actual setup.**
