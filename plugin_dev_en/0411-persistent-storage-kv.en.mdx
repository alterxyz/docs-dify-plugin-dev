title: Persistent Storage
summary: This document introduces the persistent storage feature in Dify plugins, detailing how to use the KV database within plugins to store, retrieve, and delete data. This feature enables plugins to persistently store data within the same Workspace, meeting the need for cross-session data preservation.

If you look at the Tool and Endpoint in the plug-in alone, it is not difficult to find that in most cases it can only complete a single round of interaction, the request returns the data, and the task ends.

If there is a need for long-term storage of data, such as the implementation of persistent memory, the plug-in needs to have persistent storage capabilities. **Persistent storage mechanism allows plugins to have the ability to store data persistently in the same Workspace**, currently through the provision of KV database to meet the storage needs. In the future, more flexible and powerful storage endpoints may be introduced based on actual usage.

### Storage Key

#### **Entrance**

```python
    self.session.storage
```

#### **Endpoint**

```python
    def set(self, key: str, val: bytes) -> None:
        pass
```

You can notice that a bytes is passed in, so you can actually store files in it.

### Get Key

#### **Entrance**

```python
    self.session.storage
```

#### **Endpoint**

```python
    def get(self, key: str) -> bytes:
        pass
```

### Delete Key

#### **Entrance**

```python
    self.session.storage
```

#### **Endpoint**

```python
    def delete(self, key: str) -> None:
        pass
```
